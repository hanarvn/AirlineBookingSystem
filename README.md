This is a simple console-based airline ticket booking system developed in Java SE. It simulates user registration, login, booking, and admin panel functionality.

### Admin Panel:
- Admin login
- Add new flights
- Remove existing flights
- View all available flights
- View all registered passengers

## File Structure

- `src/` – contains main source code:
  - `Main.java`
  - `Admin.java`
  - `Flights.java`
  - `Passangers.java`
  - `Data.java`
- `flights.txt` – stores available flight data
- `passengers.txt` – stores passenger data (created dynamically after registration)

## How to Run

1. Open the project in an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
2. Run the `Main.java` class.
3. Follow the menu options to log in as admin or passenger and use the system.

## Technologies

- Language: Java SE
- Data Storage: Text files (.txt)
- User Interface: Console-based (no GUI)

## Developer Note

This project was created as a personal learning exercise in object-oriented programming (OOP) and file handling using Java.
